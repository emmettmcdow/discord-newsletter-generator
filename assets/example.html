      The Community Archive Weekly
    </div>

    <div class="summary">
      This week, we're looking at the hidden maps that define our digital interactions. We explore a new proposal to
      create an "atlas" for the entire universe of AI models, revealing their lineage and how different communities
      build upon them. We also have a concrete look inside how an AI model organizes information and how major platforms
      track the very manipulation networks our archive aims to expose. Understanding these underlying structures is the
      first step toward recognizing how ideas are shaped and spread online.

      <div class="story-content">
        An AI founder's post challenges the public to interpret a complex visualization of a model's internal structure,
        sparking a fascinating public discussion on how AI organizes data. This matters to our mission because
        understanding how these systems cluster information is key to grasping how the algorithms curating our feeds
        might group ideas and influence social dynamics.

      <div class="story-content">
        Researchers have proposed a "Model Atlas" to chart the relationships between millions of AI models, tracking
        their evolution from foundational models to specialized fine-tunes and variants. This provides a powerful
        blueprint for our own work, showing how we can systematically trace the origin and spread of influential digital
        creations, be they AI models or viral narratives.

      <div class="story-content">
        Meta's public archive of "Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior" reports details its efforts to dismantle influence
        operations run by corporations and state-sponsored groups. These reports offer a crucial, real-world playbook of
        the tactics used to manipulate online debate, directly reinforcing our mission to help the public study and
        defend against these very threats.
